# Guess the Number Project

This project is a simple "Guess the Number" game implemented in React.

## Description

The "Guess the Number" game allows users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user correctly guesses the number.
